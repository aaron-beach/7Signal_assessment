This project is an assessment completed in Python. The assessment includes TDD principles(writing test cases prior to coding). Please contact me directly with any questions.

## Prerequisites

>Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

## Technologies

>Project is created with:

- Pre-commit Hooks ([pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/))
- Testing ([Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/))
- Code formatting ([Black](https://github.com/python/black) and [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/))
- Type checking ([mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/))

## Using Sample

>To use this project, follow these steps:

This project assumes you are using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to manage
virtual environments and project dependencies.

#### 1. Install project dependencies:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

#### 2. Setup project to use **pre-commit**:

```
pipenv run pre-commit install
```

#### 3. Install additional project dependencies:

```
pipenv install [package]
```

Use the **--dev** flag if needed.

#### 4. Run tests:

```
make test
```

Tests will be automatically run prior to every commit.

# TDD Kata 1 - String Calculator
http://osherove.com/kata
## Before you start:

- Try not to read ahead.
- Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
- Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata
- Test First!

## String Calculator

1. In a **test-first manner**, create a simple class `class StringCalculator`
   with a method `public int Add(string numbers)`

   - [x] The method can take **0, 1 or 2 numbers**, and will **return their sum**
   (for an **empty string** it will return **0**)
   for example
   `‚Äú‚Äù == 0 , ‚Äú1‚Äù == 1 , ‚Äú1,2‚Äù == 3`
   - [x] Start with the **simplest** test case of an **empty string** and move to **one & two numbers**
   - [x] Remember to solve things as **simply as possible** so that you force yourself to
   write tests you did not think about
   * Remember to **refactor** after each passing test


2. Allow the **Add** method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
   - [x] accept unknown number of numbers

3. Allow the **Add** method to handle **new lines** between numbers (instead of **commas**).
   - [x] the following input is ok: `‚Äú1\n2,3‚Äù == 6`

   - [x] the following is **INVALID input** so do not expect it : **`‚Äú1,\n‚Äù`** (not need to write a test for it)

4. Support different delimiters:
   to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line
   - [x] accept multiple delimiters
   that looks like this:
   `‚Äú//[delimiter]\n[numbers‚Ä¶]‚Äù`

   for example
   `‚Äú//;\n1;2‚Äù == 3`

   since the default delimiter is `‚Äò;‚Äô` .

   **Note:** All existing scenarios and tests should still be supported

5. Calling **Add** with a **negative number** will throw an **exception** ‚Äúnegatives not allowed‚Äù -
   and the **negative that was passed**.
   - [x] throw exception
   - [x] display msg and err

6. If there are **multiple negatives**, show all of them in the **exception message**
   - [x] throw exception
   - [x] display msg with multi negatives

7. Using **TDD**, Add a method to `StringCalculator`
   called `public int GetCalledCount()`
   that returns how many times `Add()` was invoked.
   **Remember** - Start with a **failing (or even non compiling**) test.
   - [x] add method `public int GetCalledCount()`
   - [x] return count of `add()`

8. (.NET Only) Using TDD, Add an **event** to the `StringCalculator` class named
   `public event Action<string, int> AddOccured` ,
   that is triggered after every `Add()` call.

   ***Hint**:
   Create the **event** declaration first:
   then write a failing test that listens to the event
   and proves it should have been triggered when calling **Add()**.
   ***Hint 2**:
   Example:

```
   string giveninput = null;
   sc.AddOccured += delegate(string input, int result)
   {
      giveninput = input;
   };
```

9. Numbers bigger than **1000** should be **ignored**, for example:
   `2 + 1001 == 2`
   - [x] ignore numbers above 1000

10. Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:
    `‚Äú//[delimiter]\n‚Äù`
    - [x] passed delimiter of any length
    for example:
    `‚Äú//[***]\n1***2***3‚Äù == 6`

11. Allow multiple delimiters like this:
    `‚Äú//[delim1][delim2]\n‚Äù`
    - [x] passed multiple delimiters
    for example
    `‚Äú//[*][%]\n1*2%3‚Äù == 6.`

12. make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with **length longer than one char**
    for example
    `‚Äú//[**][%%]\n1**2%%3‚Äù == 6.`
    - [x] passed multiple delimiters of any length
